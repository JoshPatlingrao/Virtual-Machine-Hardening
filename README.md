# Virtual-Machine-Hardening

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to setup a hardened Arch Linux installation in a virtual machine. The skills developed in this project will be the usage of CLI, researching documentations, generating backups and applying security configurations based on the foundations of Security+.

## Skills Learned
- Setting up Linux installation and configuration through CLI.
- Researching online documentation and applying changes based on the current version of the OS.
- Generating snapshots with brief descriptions as backups.

## Tools Used
- Oracle VM Virtual Box
- Arch Linux

## Steps
### 1. Download VirtualBox and Arch Linux

### 2. Configure VM

### 3. Install Arch

### 4. Configure Arch Security Configurations
#### 4.1 Kernel - Sysctle
Kernel hardening is a vital part of Linux security. Without these sceurity configurations a base Linux kernel can be vulnerable against exploits which allows an attacker to escalate privileges and accessing sensitive files.

Sysctl is the tool that's used to permanently modify certain kernel tunables.
